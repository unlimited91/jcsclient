    iam


DESCRIPTION :

    Jio Cloud Services Identity and Access Management (JCS IAM) service provides
    authentication and authorization that enables users to securely access Jio Cloud Services
    (JCS) resources in a controlled manner. Using IAM, you can create and manage users and
    groups, and use permissions to allow and deny access to JCS resources. By default, every
    user in JCS starts with no permissions. To use JCS services, a user needs to be explicitly
    provisioned with permissions on JCS resources.
    JCS IAM enables specific controls on who can do what in the root JCS account by creating
    users, assigning users to groups, and provisioning the users and groups with fine grained
    access controls known as policies within a JCS root account.
