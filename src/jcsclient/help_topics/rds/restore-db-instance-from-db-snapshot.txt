NAME :
    restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot 


DESCRIPTION :
    To restore a DB instance from an existing DB Instance snapshot, use the RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot action.
    Until RDS completes the restore, you cannot perform any action on the snapshot.
    When the restoration is complete, the snapshot returns to the available state.


SYNOPSIS :
    restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot 
    --db-instance-identifier <string>
    --db-snapshot-identifier <string>
    [--db-instance-class <string>]
    [--preferred-maintenance-window <string>]
    [--preferred-backup-window <string>]
    [--backup-retention-period <integer>]


OPTIONS :
    [] => optional parameters

    --db-instance-identifier <string> 
        The DB instance identifier.

    --db-snapshot-identifier <string>
        The identifier of the DB snapshot.
        
    [--db-instance-class <string>]
        The instance class that represents a specific compute and memory capacity of the JCS DB instance.
        If unspecified, RDS uses the instance class specification of the DB instance from which the snapshot was obtained.
        Valid values: c1.small | c1.medium | c1.large | c1.xlarge

    [--preferred-maintenance-window <string>]
        The weekly time period during which system maintenance can
        occur. This period might result in a brief outage.
        Format: ddd:hh24:mi- ddd:hh24:mi
        Default: A random 30 minute window chosen during the night (10:00 pm - 6:00 am).

    [--preferred-backup-window <string>]
        Specify the daily time range during which JCS runs the automated backup tasks, provided BackupRetentionPeriod is greater
        than 0. Make sure to select a time period when you expect the least amount of DB instance access to maximize performance.
        Format: hh24:mi- hh24:mi
        Default: A random 30 minute window chosen during the night (10:00 pm - 6:00 am).

    [--backup-retention-period <integer>]
        Specify a value greater than 0 (in days) to enable Automated backups. JCS RDS retains
        the automated DB snapshot backups till the specified period.
        Any automated backups exceeding the cut-off days are deleted.
        Maximum days to retain: 35.
