DESCRIPTION :
    JCS Relational Database Service (RDS) is a fully managed service that ensures that you can easily
    set up, operate, and scale a Relational Database in the cloud. With RDS service you are completely
    saved from performing time-consuming database administration tasks and hence you can focus on building
    your application. Being built on top of JCS IaaS, RDS is Secure, Durable and Highly Available, by default.

    There is no need to invest hours in setting up your database. Just enter bare minimum information and 
    we will spin up a fully managed database for you. Do not worry about taking backups, scheduling maintenance
    and updating database engines. RDS takes away administration out of your database by automating everything
    for you.
